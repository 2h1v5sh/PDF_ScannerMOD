# PDF_scanner
Building an Antivirus Tool to Scan PDF Files for Malicious Content using Python 

### 1. Modular Design
Break down the code into modules: Separate the code into different modules for better readability, maintainability, and reusability. For example, have separate modules for logging, YARA rule handling, PDF processing, and configuration management.
### 2. Custom Exception Handling
Create custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios like corrupted PDFs, YARA rule compilation failures, and file I/O errors. This approach provides clearer error messages and makes debugging easier.
### 3. Asynchronous I/O
Utilize asynchronous I/O (using asyncio and aiofiles) to handle file reading/writing operations more efficiently, especially when dealing with a large number of PDFs.
### 4. Advanced Configuration Management
Use configparser or yaml to manage configurations, enabling the tool to be more customizable.
Allow dynamic reloading of configurations without restarting the tool.
### 5. Database Integration
Integrate a database (like SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store scan results, including metadata, detected threats, and scan timestamps.
This would enable historical analysis and provide audit trails.
### 6. Reporting and Notifications
Implement a reporting mechanism that generates detailed scan reports in formats like JSON, CSV, or HTML.
Include email notifications or integration with Slack/Teams to alert administrators about potential threats immediately.
### 7. CI/CD Integration and Testing
Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI to automate testing and deployment.
Write unit tests and integration tests using unittest or pytest to ensure code reliability.
### 8. Security Enhancements
Sandbox Execution: Run the PDF processing in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any malicious content.
Input Validation: Ensure robust validation of input files to prevent attacks like path traversal.
### 9. Performance Monitoring
Implement performance monitoring using tools like prometheus with Grafana dashboards to visualize CPU usage, memory consumption, and scan throughput.
### 10. Deployment and Scalability
Containerize the application using Docker for consistent deployment across different environments.
Consider using Kubernetes for scaling the application horizontally in production.
